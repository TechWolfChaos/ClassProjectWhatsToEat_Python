-Ingredients list-
2 slices hearty white or wheat bread (see note)
Dijon mustard, optional (but delicious)
Brie cheese, thinly sliced (rind removed if preferred)
2 slices deli turkey meat or leftover cooked turkey
2 to 3 tablespoons cranberry sauce, more or less to taste
6 to 8 baby spinach leaves
Butter, for grilling/panini-ing

<---------- HOW TO MAKE IT ------------>
On one slice of bread spread Dijon according to taste.
Layer on Brie, turkey, cranberry sauce, spinach, and another layer of Brie cheese.
Top with the other slice of bread. Butter the outsides of the bread or heat butter in a nonstick skillet, a griddle, or panini press until sizzling.
Cook the sandwich in the hot skillet/griddle/panini press, pressing down with a spatula or a heavy saucepan (if you arenâ€™t using an actual panini press), flipping halfway through, until the bread is golden on both sides, and the cheese is melted.
Serve immediately.
