Serving: 1 | Calories: 546kcal | Carbohydrates: 62g | Protein: 34g | Fat: 28g |
*******************************************************************************

-Ingredients list-
3-4 chicken breasts cut into strips
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
½ teaspoon oregano
½ teaspoon dried parsley
5-6 medium-sized red potatoes cut into cubes
½ medium-sized yellow onion cut into slivers (aka “feathered”)
1 tablespoon olive oil
¼ stick butter
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (3 parts oregano, 2 parts marjoram, 2 parts thyme, 1 part basil, 1 part rosemary, 1 part sage)

<---------- HOW TO MAKE IT ------------>
Heat a large skillet on medium-high and add the butter and olive oil. Cook until the butter foams a little and starts to turn brown (pic 2). Put the slivered onion in the pan, reduce heat to medium-low. 

Cook until the onions start to caramelize -turn brown and are translucent. Add the potatoes (don’t overload the skillet) and sprinkle Italian seasoning into the pan. Use your own judgment on the amount, start with about 1 teaspoon and go from there. Increase heat back to medium and cook until potatoes are browned and tender. Mix the pan 3 or 4 times to cook it evenly. TIP: If you cover the pan for a few minutes, it will help the potatoes become more tender.

First, cut the chicken breast into strips.

Heat a large skillet (medium heat) with the olive oil and butter in it.

Mix all the spices in a small bowl or cup.

Put the chicken strips into a mixing bowl and sprinkle the seasoning mix all over. Blend well.

Put the chicken into the skillet and cook until browned and cooked through. This should take about 6-8 minutes. Test by cutting into the largest piece and observing if there is any pink. Keep cooking another minute or 2 if you see any pink.

When the chicken is cooked just right, remove it from the pan and serve with the potatoes.
