-Nutrition Info per serving-
Serving: 1 | Calories: 624 kcal | Carbohydrates: 26g | Protein: 22g | Fat: 32.95g |
***********************************************************************************

-Ingredients list-
1/2 lb (650g) chicken breast, cut into strips
1 1/2 lb (650g) baby yellow potatoes, quartered
1 tablespoon olive oil
3 tablespoons butter, divided
5 garlic cloves, minced
1 teaspoon fresh thyme, chopped
1 teaspoon fresh rosemary, chopped
1 teaspoon fresh oregano, chopped
Salt and fresh cracked pepper
Crushed red chili pepper flakes, optional

-The marinade-
1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce (or coconut amino if you’re strictly paleo)
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon hot sauce (we used Sriracha)
Fresh cracked pepper

<---------- HOW TO MAKE IT ------------>
1. To make the garlic butter chicken with potatoes: In a large bowl, combine the chicken strips with low sodium soy sauce, olive oil, pepper, and hot sauce. Set aside to marinate while you cook potatoes.
2. Parboil the potatoes in boiling salted water for 8 minutes. This will accelerate cooking time in the skillet and ensure a nice golden crust on the potatoes.
3. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, mix 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter. When the butter is melted, add drained potatoes. Cook potatoes for about 4 minutes, stir, and cook an additional 4-5 minutes until potatoes are golden and fork-tender. Transfer sauteed potatoes to a plate and set aside.
4. Keep the same skillet over medium heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, lay the chicken strips in one layer in the skillet, keeping the drained marinade for later. Add garlic and red chili pepper flakes to the chicken. Cook chicken strips on each side for 1 minute each until nicely browned – adjust timing depending on how you like your grilled chicken.
5. Stir in the reserved marinade and cook with chicken until the marinade is cooked. Add the fresh herbs and give a quick stir. Then add the sauteed potatoes back to the pan and heat through. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.
6. Remove from heat and serve immediately your Garlic Butter Chicken Recipe with sauteed Potatoes, garnished with more crushed chili pepper, fresh herbs, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese over the Chicken and Potatoes if you like. Enjoy!

2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
1 cup chopped bell pepper (green, red, or a mix of colors)
3 medium Yukon Gold potatoes, diced very small (¼-inch cubes) - about 3 ½ cups total
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided (see notes)
½ teaspoon black pepper, divided
3 tablespoons taco seasoning, divided
¾ cup water, divided
1 lb. lean ground turkey (I use 7% fat and it’s sometimes 1.0 or 1.25 pounds; either is fine)


<---------- HOW TO MAKE IT ------------>
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, peppers, and potatoes and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add garlic and cook for another 30 seconds.

Season with ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon black pepper, and 1 tablespoon taco seasoning. Add ¼ cup water and let simmer on medium-low for 3-4 minutes, until liquid is absorbed.

Remove the potato mixture to a bowl.

Turn the heat up to medium again and add the ground turkey to the same skillet (I find there’s no need to add more oil). Season with remaining salt and pepper and cook until no pink remains, breaking it up with a spatula as it cooks, about 8-9 minutes total.

Season turkey with one tablespoon of taco seasoning and add ¼ cup water. (You can use a little less if there’s a lot of liquid in the pan.) Let simmer on medium-low heat for 3-4 minutes.

Add the potato mixture back to the skillet and stir to get everything well combined. Add the remaining tablespoon of taco seasoning and another 2-3 tablespoons of water. Simmer on medium-low heat for 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Serve piled high with your favorite taco toppings and enjoy!
