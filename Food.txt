-Ingredients list-
4 pounds skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs
3 russet potatoes, peeled and quartered
½ cup fresh lemon juice
½ cup olive oil
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon dried rosemary
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 pinch of cayenne pepper
1 cup chicken broth, divided
1 teaspoon chopped fresh oregano, or to taste

<---------- HOW TO MAKE IT ------------>
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly oil a large roasting pan.

Place chicken and potatoes in a large bowl. Add lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, dried oregano, salt, rosemary, black pepper, and cayenne. Toss until chicken and potatoes are evenly coated.

Place chicken pieces skin-side up in the prepared pan. Tuck potato pieces around the chicken. Drizzle with 2/3 cup chicken broth. Spoon any remaining marinade from the bowl over the chicken and potatoes.

Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Toss chicken and potatoes, then place the chicken skin-side up again.

Continue baking until chicken is browned and cooked through, about 25 minutes more; an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should register 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Transfer chicken to a serving platter and keep warm; leave potatoes in the pan.

Turn on the broiler, or set the oven to the highest heat. Toss potatoes again to coat in pan juices. Place the pan under the broiler and broil until potatoes are crisped, about 3 minutes.

Transfer potatoes to the platter with chicken.

Place the roasting pan on the stovetop over medium heat. Add the remaining 1/3 cup chicken broth and scrape up browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Strain pan juices over chicken and potatoes. Sprinkle with fresh oregano.

Melt butter in pan with olive oil then add chicken and cook for 3 minutes then flip and cook opposite side until chicken has cooked through (center of larger pieces should register 165 degrees), about 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm.

Heat the remaining 1 Tbsp oil and 1 Tbsp butter in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add zucchini and squash, then season with salt, 1 tsp Italian seasoning, and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. Cook tossing occasionally until just tender, about 4 minutes. 

Return chicken to the pan with zucchini and squash. Drizzle in lemon juice and toss. Sprinkle with parmesan and parsley. Serve warm with more parmesan and lemon zest if desired (I served mine over cooked orzo which is delicious).

Notes
*1 Tbsp minced fresh garlic may be substituted. Add half of it to the chicken halfway through cooking and add half to the zucchini/squash when added to the skillet.

********************************************************************************

-Ingredients list-
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
12 ounces fettuccine
Olive oil, for tossing
12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 2) 
1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter
2 cups heavy cream
2 pinches of freshly grated nutmeg
1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

<---------- HOW TO MAKE IT ------------>
Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente (tender but still slightly firm). Drain and toss with a splash of oil.

Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 1/4-inch-thick strips, and lay them on a plate or a sheet of waxed paper. Season with salt and pepper.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high and add the chicken in 1 layer. Cook, without moving the pieces, until the underside has browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the pieces, and cook until browned and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a medium bowl.

Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons of butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce just warm.
Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken and cooked pasta and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot in heated bowls.

2 cups pineapple, chopped into small cubes
1 ½ cups cantaloupe, chopped into small cubes
1 cup tomato, chopped into small cubes
¼ cup red onion, minced
¼ cup cilantro, chopped finely
2 tablespoons lime juice freshly squeezed
Salt and pepper to taste

Pan-seared black cod

<---------- HOW TO MAKE IT ------------>
Mix all chopped ingredients for tropical fruit salsa in a large bowl, add lime juice, add salt and pepper to taste. Set aside to let the juices combine together.

To prepare seasoning for the fish, mix salt, pepper, paprika, oregano, and cumin in a small bowl.
Heat a large skillet on high heat. Season fish on the non-skin side with salt & pepper and other spices from step 2, generously. Add oil to the hot skillet: the oil should sizzle. Add fish to the skillet non-skin side down (skin side up) and sear for 4 minutes, moving the fish around the skillet to make sure oil coats the surface of the fish and that the fish is not sticking to the pan while searing.

After these 4 minutes, turn the fish over to the skin side and sear for another 3 minutes on high heat. After searing on the skin side, you can actually remove salmon skin easily at this point and discard, it if you don’t like to eat it.

Prepare the stir-fry sauce: Add the beef stock cornstarch, dark brown sugar, oyster sauce, soy sauce, & 1 teaspoon of sesame oil to a small bowl or jar. Whisk or shake to combine well. Set aside. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon sesame oil to a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the garlic & cook until fragrant & lightly browned, 30 seconds – 1 minute. Stir in the beef stock mixture & cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 4-5 minutes. Remove from the heat & set aside.

Stir fry the vegetables: Meanwhile, as the stir fry sauce thickens, begin the stir fry. Add 1 teaspoon of the grapeseed oil to a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot & shimmering, add the carrots & broccoli. Lightly season with a small pinch of salt & cook, stirring often, until vibrantly colored & softened slightly, 3-4 minutes.

Sear the beef & finish the stir fry: Add the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil to the wok or skillet & reduce the heat to medium. Once hot & shimmering, add the marinated beef from Step 1. Shake the pan to separate the slices of beef for even browning. Cook, tossing & stirring occasionally, just until browned. While stirring, pour the prepared stir-fry sauce from Step 2 into the skillet. Add the stir-fried vegetables back into the skillet. Cook 1-2 minutes longer, tossing & stirring frequently to bring the beef and vegetable stir fry together. Remove from the heat.

Place a 10” cast iron skillet into an oven preheated at 375˚F, for 10 minutes.
Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and add 2 tablespoons of butter and oil, swirling the melting butter across the entire surface.
Add shredded potatoes and spread them into an even layer and create 3 pockets within the potatoes. Season with salt and pepper.

Dot 1 1/2 tablespoons butter over the surface and transfer the skillet back into the oven for 15-18 minutes.
Remove the skillet from the oven and dot each pocket within the potatoes with 1 teaspoon of butter. Add a cracked egg into each pocket, top the potatoes with shredded cheese, and return the skillet to the oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until the egg whites are set, with the yolks still creamy and the top of the potatoes golden brown.

Season with salt and pepper and finish with a sprinkle of chives. Serve.

Spaghetti With Fried Eggs
*************************

-Nutrition Info per serving-
Serving: 1 | Calories: 370kcal | Carbohydrates: 34 | Protein: 14g | Fat: 24g |
******************************************************************************

-Ingredients list-
Salt
½pound thin spaghetti
6tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or lard
2 large cloves garlic, lightly smashed and peeled
4eggs
Freshly ground black pepper
Freshly grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese, optional

<---------- HOW TO MAKE IT ------------>
Bring a pot of salted water to the boil. Start the sauce in the next step, and start cooking the pasta when the water boils.

Step 2
Combine garlic and 4 tablespoons of the oil in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Cook the garlic, pressing it into the oil occasionally to release its flavor; it should barely color on both sides. Remove the garlic, and add the remaining oil.

Step 3
Fry the eggs gently in the oil, until the whites are just about set and the yolks still quite runny. Drain the pasta, and toss with the eggs and oil, breaking up the whites as you do. (The eggs will finish cooking in the heat of the pasta.) Season to taste, and serve immediately, with cheese if you like.
